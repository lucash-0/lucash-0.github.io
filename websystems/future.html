  <h2>Change of course</h2>

  <p>
    Currently, I am studying Computing Science majoring in Business Information Systems at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). However, I was previously studying Communications majoring in Public Relations at UTS. I studied for one year in 2016 but found that I wasnâ€™t suited to the course or a career in public relations. In 2017 I took a gap year and travelled around Europe where I decided to play to my strengths and passion, changing courses to Computer Science. The decision to switch courses was one that worked out very well for myself and into the future I plan to continue my studies and further improve my knowledge in Computer Science.

  <h2>Working 9 to 5, yeah more like 5am</h2>

  <p>
    In the future, I hope to secure internships with a variety of technology-based companies. An assortment of internships will give me the experience I need to get the perfect career in computer science as well as the skills to go off and create my own entrepreneurial business. I understand that a career is a more stable option to undertake in this industry, I personally want to enjoy the potentially fruitful and fulfilling venture that is starting your own business. I find the idea of starting a business exciting and interesting, especially in a rapidly growing industry that is computing. Technology changes so fast and being at the forefront will allow me to take more interest in my work as well as potentially generating a well earning and exciting startup.
