    <h2>Who is Lucas?</h2>

    <p>
      Me. I'm Lucas, and this is my Web Systems website. I'm studying Computing Science at UTS majoring in Business Information.
      I enjoy coding, computers and technology as a whole as well as watching sport, playing games and travelling.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Okay that's cool and all, but what even is Web Systems?</h2>

    <p class="i">
      I'm assuming 99% of anyone reading this already knows but here it is anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://handbook.uts.edu.au/subjects/31268.html" title="UTS Subject Handbook - Websystems">Web Systems</a> is an introduction to information technology using the web as a core case study.
      This website is the final product of a practical assignment in which I was tasked with creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.
      The assignment states that the website covers content about yourself (or myself?) and hence that is why this website has a personal flair.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Ah I get it now. Neat! Anything else I need to know?</h2>

    <p>
      Nope! But if you want to contact me my student email is in the top right hand corner (or just <a href="mailto:lucas.m.hahn@student.uts.edu.au" title="Link to Lucas's student email lucas.m.hahn@student.uts.edu.au">click here</a>).
      If you want to see the source for all the images and icons used in the website checkout <a href="sources.html" title="Source pages with links to codes, images and fonts">the sources page.</a>
      This website uses a tiny bit of javascript, however, no javascript is required for the functionality of the website and 99% of the styles will remain the same.
      It'll just seem a little bit more static-y ;).
    </p>

    <p>
      And just a little <span class="i">tabular</span> bonus... (credit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww" title="Link to the subreddit aww">/r/aww</a>):
